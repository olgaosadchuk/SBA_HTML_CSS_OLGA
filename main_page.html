            CAT FAMILY</p>
          <p><b>The big cats are the four members of the genus <u>Panthera</u>.
              These cats are unique not only in sheer size but also in their
              ability to roar. A specialized larynx and a unique part of the
              throat called a hyoid apparatus to allow for the production of a
              true, deep roaring sound. From the ocelot to the mighty lion, wild
              cats are some of the most fascinating animals on our planet. Out
              of the 36+ different species of wild cats, there are a select few
              that stand out for their sheer size and strength. That’s right,
              we’re talking about THE big cats. And we’ve got the answers to
              your most popular questions.</b>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold">The
              term "big cat"</p>
            <p><b> is typically used to refer to any of the five living members
                of the genus Panthera, namely the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard,
                and snow leopard, as well as the non-pantherine cheetah and
                cougar. Except for the latter three, these species are able to
                roar.
                Despite enormous differences in size, various cat species are
                quite similar in both structure and behaviour, with the exception
                of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other
                big and small cats. All cats are carnivores and some are
                efficient apex predators. Their native ranges include the
                Americas, Africa, and Asia; the leopard's range also extends
                into European Russia.</b></p>

                  While the cougar, cheetah, snow leopard and clouded leopard
                  are also fairly large, and occasionally included in this
                  group, their larynx creates more of a combination hiss/snarl
                  sound without the bass tone of a real roar</b></p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px"> <b>Even self-professed dog people have
                to marvel at the power and grace of big cats. Large felines are
                both ferocious and beautiful, capable of inspiring awe and
                terror at the same time – it’s little wonder they have become
                the stuff of folklore and legend all around the world.</b>
